* so the program wants some passwords for the flag
* I looked at the program, it was using a master string( named ```a```) which had all the characters in it
* the program was using indexing on the master string to print sentences.
* I just copied the master string and made a ```new.py``` file and found what the endex combinations were
* doing that made everything clear, the program wanted ```happychance``` as the password input
* this gave the flag.
