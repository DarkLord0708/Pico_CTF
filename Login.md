enetring a random string in the username and password fields said, icorrect username. Then I tired "admin" as username then prompt said incorrect password. So, I luckily found the username.
Also nothing was happening in inspect elements when I was pressing submit. So, there was no serverside involvement in this.
To look at the source code, used "Ctrl+U", then looked at index.js
